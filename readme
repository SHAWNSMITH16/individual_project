Project Title : Predicting Defensive Player of the Year in the NFL

Project Description :

This project aims to generate a list of players most deserving of the NFL's defensive player of the year based on the players statistics accumulated for the given season.

The data was obtained on 26 January 2023 from pro-football-reference.com, it downloaded as ten .csv files (there were 2 files for each year from 2018 to 2022, one consisting of advanced statistical metrics and the other of standard statistical metrics)

Credit for the data goes to :

Hypothesis :

Is it possible to predict the defensive player of the year based on player statistics?

Data Dictionary :

Feature                                Definition

**Player**           Player's Name
**Tm**               Player's Team (If player was traded mid-season, team will display "2TM")
**Pos**              Player's Position on Defense (categorized into DL(Defensive Lineman), LB(Linebacker), or DB(Defensive Back)
**Int**              Completion Percentage allowed when targeted by opposing team
**Sk**               Number of times opposing QB was tackled before they threw the ball(sacks)
**Comb**             Total number of Solo Tackles and Tackle assists
**PD**               Number of Passes Deflected resulting in an incomplete pass
**FF**               Forced Fumbles caused
**FR**               Number of Fumbles Recovered
**TFL**              Tackles that resulted in a loss of yardage
**ppds**             Pass Play Disruption Score (combines QB hurries, QB knockdowns, QB hits, and sacks)
**TDs**              Defensive TDs scored
**DBR**              Defensive Back Rating
**DLR**              Defensive Lineman Rating
**LBR**              Linebacker Rating
**ODR**              Overall Defensive Rating

**The Process / Project Plan :

Obtain, explore and analyze defensive statistics and generate formulas to accurately categorize the best players in the NFL from a defensive standpoint and determine who should win DPOY

Analyze features in the cleaned data based on what statistics weigh more heavily in favor of three main defensive categories, Defensive Backs, Defensive Linemen, and Linebackers. 

Using the most relevant statistics, generate formulas to assign all ratings for each defensive categorical position. 

Using those three new ratings, generate an overall rating formula and assign that score to each player as the target metric.

Provide suggestions and indicate next steps that could be performed.

**For Further Exploration :

Find a way to determine if the player's team success weighs on the outcome of the DPOY voting.

Find a way to see if media attention can cause bias in voters' decision when voting

**Enhance Formulas :

Use media coverage and team success as an added metric to finetune the formula to get an even better result

**Steps To Reproduce :

Assure the presence of a Python environment on your computer.

Import :

Python libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scipy,
The advanced and standard defensive stats databases from https://pro-football-reference.com and save the file locally
Pre-existing or self-created data 'acquire' and 'prepare' modules.
Tidy the data.

Explore using graphs, statistical evaluation, feature engineering, finetune formulas

Evaluate, analyse and form conclusions and recommendations and indicate next steps.
